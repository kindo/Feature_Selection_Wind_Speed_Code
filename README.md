**Highlights**
* Six feature selection methods were evaluated for wind speed quantiles estimation at ungauged locations.
* Feature selection enabled the identification of the most important predictors for various wind speed quantiles.
* The most parsimonious feature selection methods led to the lowest generalization error.
* The location distance from the coast, and the surface roughness were the most significant wind speed quantiles predictors.
